        <p>
        I got my bachelor's degree from Al-Baath University as a Software Engineering and Informatics Systems 
        specialist with a good rating. Then I spent one year in the Master of Software Engineering and Network Systems 
        in Hungary, which introduced many new fields and concepts to me. Recently I had my Master's degree in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPS2).
<br/><br/>
I am very interested in working in the programming field, whereas I know many programming languages and have done many
 projects with various languages. I like the challenge in programming, whereas you should search for the new tricks and do 
 daily research for the new ideas, especially when you have a mission you should solve.
 <br/>
 <br/>
I also have the knowledge, skills, and the ability to work in many different fields such as IoT, WoS, 
smart transportation, processing data, and the research field. I am now looking for a Ph.D. position where I can 
improve myself and introduce new research that can help in improving the community, or a good job position where 
I can refine my skills and get new skills.
